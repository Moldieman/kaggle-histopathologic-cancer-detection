# CSCS4652 | Week 3 | Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project

## GitHub Repo: [Repo URL](https://github.com/Moldieman/kaggle-histopathologic-cancer-detection)

## Introduction
This is the Histopathologic Cancer Detection project repository.  This project is based on a Kaggle competition with the goal of developing an image classification algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections.

## Project Description
The primary challenge in this competition is to create a model that can accurately classify microscopic images of lymph node sections as containing metastatic tissue or not. This repository includes the code for building and training a CNN to tackle this problem. The model is developed in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.


## File Descriptions
- `cnn-cancer-detection-kaggle-mini-project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with the CNN model development and training process.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, containing information about this project.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample of the format that Kaggle expects for submissions.
- `submission.csv`: The final submission file with predictions made by the trained model.

## Installation
To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Pandas. These can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas
```

## Usage
To use this project, start by cloning the repository and navigating to the directory containing the `cnn-cancer-detection-kaggle-mini-project.ipynb` notebook.

```bash
jupyter cnn-cancer-detection-kaggle-mini-project.ipynb
```
